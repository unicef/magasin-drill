# Security Policy

Magasin team welcomes feedback from security researchers and the general public to help improve our security. 

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability, privacy issue, exposed data, or other security issues in any of our assets,
we want to hear from you. 

In this [link](https://unicef.github.com/magasin/contributing/vulnerability-disclosure.html) you have our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://unicef.github.com/magasin/contributing/vulnerability-disclosure.html) which outlines steps for reporting vulnerabilities to us, 
what we expect, what you can expect from us.
